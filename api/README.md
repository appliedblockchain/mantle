# Mantle API

### `Setup`

Install dependencies with `npm install`

An instance of the default server can be run with `npm start`; It listens on port `3000` by default and all routes are prefixed by `/api`.

Alternatively it can be used as a dependency in other projects; See [Usage.md](Usage.md)

### `Tests`

To run the api tests:

`ipfs daemon`
`npm run test`
